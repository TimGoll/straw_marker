# Straw Marker

In an effort to reduce plastic waste on parties I came up with the idea to give each straw an individual marker. This would make it more easy for the guests to remember which glass belongs to them. I looked through thingiverse for nice 3D models that are suitable for this job and then modified those with a ring so they can be slid on the straws.
